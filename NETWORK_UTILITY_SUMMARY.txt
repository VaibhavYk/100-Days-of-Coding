FEATURES:
---------
✓ Display Public IP Address (using external API)
✓ Display Local IP Address (using Windows API)
✓ Ping websites and show latency statistics
✓ Basic internet speed test (download speed)
✓ Interactive menu-driven interface
✓ Cross-platform support (Windows primary, Linux secondary)
✓ Comprehensive error handling
✓ Clear, commented code for learning

COMPILATION:
------------

Windows (MinGW):
    gcc network_utility.c -o network_utility.exe -lws2_32 -liphlpapi

Windows (Visual Studio):
    cl network_utility.c ws2_32.lib iphlpapi.lib

Linux (for testing):
    gcc network_utility.c -o network_utility

Using Makefile:
    make windows    # For Windows
    make linux      # For Linux
    make            # Auto-detect platform

USAGE:
------
1. Compile the program (see above)
2. Run: network_utility.exe (Windows) or ./network_utility (Linux)
3. Choose from menu options:
   - Option 1: Show Public IP
   - Option 2: Show Local IP
   - Option 3: Ping a website
   - Option 4: Test internet speed
   - Option 5: Run all tests
   - Option 0: Exit

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- Windows 7 or later (primary target)
- GCC compiler (MinGW-w64) or Visual Studio
- curl.exe (included in Windows 10+)
- Internet connection (for public IP and speed test)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- Language: C (C99 standard)
- Windows APIs: Winsock2, IP Helper API
- External Tools: curl (for public IP and speed test)
- System Commands: ping (for latency testing)
- Libraries: ws2_32.lib, iphlpapi.lib

CODE STRUCTURE:
---------------
Main Components:
  - main()              : Entry point, menu loop
  - displayMenu()       : Show menu options
  - getPublicIP()       : Fetch public IP via API
  - getLocalIP()        : Get local IP using Windows API
  - pingWebsite()       : Ping and show latency
  - testInternetSpeed() : Download speed test
  - clearInputBuffer()  : Input handling helper

Key Technologies:
  - Winsock2: Windows socket programming
  - IP Helper API: Network adapter information
  - popen(): Execute system commands
  - GetAdaptersAddresses(): Query network adapters

LEARNING RESOURCES:
-------------------
1. README_NETWORK_UTILITY.md  - User guide with examples
2. CODE_EXPLANATION.md        - Line-by-line code explanation
3. WINDOWS_SETUP.md           - Setup and troubleshooting guide

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
---------------
========================================
   Network Utility Program
========================================

========================================
1. Show Public IP Address
2. Show Local IP Address
3. Ping a Website
4. Test Internet Speed
5. Run All Tests
0. Exit
========================================
Enter your choice: 5

--- Complete Network Diagnostics ---

1. Public IP Address:
Your Public IP: 203.0.113.45

2. Local IP Address:
Adapter: Wi-Fi
Local IP: 192.168.1.100

3. Ping Test (google.com):
Sending 4 ping requests to google.com...
Reply from 142.250.185.46: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=117
Average = 15ms

4. Speed Test:
Downloaded in 0.523 seconds
Download Speed: 14.56 Mbps

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Issue: "gcc not recognized"
Fix: Install MinGW-w64 and add to PATH

Issue: "curl not found"
Fix: Install curl (included in Windows 10+)

Issue: "Failed to initialize Winsock"
Fix: Run as Administrator, check firewall

Issue: No local IP displayed
Fix: Check network connection, run as Administrator

Issue: Ping fails
Fix: Enable ICMP in Windows Firewall

For detailed troubleshooting, see WINDOWS_SETUP.md

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Read WINDOWS_SETUP.md to install compiler
2. Compile the program using provided commands
3. Run and test all features
4. Read CODE_EXPLANATION.md to understand the code
5. Modify and enhance as needed
