WELCOME!
========

This is a comprehensive C program that displays IP addresses, pings websites,
and tests internet speed. It's designed for Windows with clear, commented code
to help you learn network programming in C.


WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES:
=======================

✓ Displays your PUBLIC IP address (the one visible to the internet)
✓ Displays your LOCAL IP address (your address on your home/office network)
✓ Pings any website and shows average latency (response time)
✓ Tests your internet download speed
✓ All in an easy-to-use menu interface


QUICK START (3 STEPS):
======================

Step 1: Install a C Compiler
-----------------------------
   You need GCC (MinGW) or Visual Studio.
   
   → Read: WINDOWS_SETUP.md (detailed instructions)
   → Quick: Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/
            Then run: pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc

Step 2: Compile the Program
----------------------------
   Open Command Prompt in this folder and run:
   
   gcc network_utility.c -o network_utility.exe -lws2_32 -liphlpapi

Step 3: Run the Program
------------------------
   network_utility.exe
   
   Then choose from the menu!

RECOMMENDED READING ORDER:
==========================

For Users (Just want to run it):
---------------------------------
1. START_HERE.txt (this file)
2. QUICK_REFERENCE.txt
3. WINDOWS_SETUP.md (if you need help installing compiler)
4. README_NETWORK_UTILITY.md (for detailed usage)

For Learners (Want to understand the code):
--------------------------------------------
1. START_HERE.txt (this file)
2. WINDOWS_SETUP.md (setup your environment)
3. Compile and run the program
4. CODE_EXPLANATION.md (detailed code walkthrough)
5. Experiment with modifying the code!


WHAT YOU NEED:
==============

Required:
---------
✓ Windows 7 or later
✓ GCC compiler (MinGW-w64) OR Visual Studio
✓ curl.exe (included in Windows 10+)

Optional:
---------
○ Internet connection (for public IP and speed test)
○ Administrator privileges (for some features)


FEATURES EXPLAINED:
===================

1. Public IP Address
   ------------------
   Shows your IP address as seen by the internet. This is assigned by your
   Internet Service Provider (ISP). Useful for:
   - Setting up remote access
   - Troubleshooting network issues
   - Checking if you're behind a VPN

2. Local IP Address
   -----------------
   Shows your IP address on your local network (home/office). Usually starts
   with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x. Useful for:
   - Setting up local servers
   - Network troubleshooting
   - Connecting devices on same network

3. Ping Website
   -------------
   Sends test packets to a website and measures response time. Shows:
   - If the website is reachable
   - How fast the connection is (latency)
   - Packet loss (if any)
   
   Lower ping = better (15-30ms is excellent, 50-100ms is good)

4. Internet Speed Test
   --------------------
   Downloads a test file and calculates your download speed in Mbps.
   Note: This is a basic test. For accurate results, use speedtest.net


EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
===============

C:\> network_utility.exe

========================================
   Network Utility Program

Average = 15ms

4. Speed Test:
Downloaded in 0.523 seconds
Average speed: 1912045 bytes/sec
Download Speed: 14.56 Mbps


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Problem: "gcc is not recognized"
Solution: Install MinGW-w64 and add to PATH
          See WINDOWS_SETUP.md for detailed instructions

Problem: "curl not found"
Solution: Install curl (included in Windows 10+)
          Or download from https://curl.se/windows/

Problem: "Failed to initialize Winsock"
Solution: Run as Administrator
          Right-click → Run as administrator

Problem: Compilation errors
Solution: Make sure you include both libraries:
          -lws2_32 -liphlpapi

Problem: No local IP displayed
Solution: Check network connection is active
          Try running as Administrator

Problem: Ping fails
Solution: Check firewall settings
          Enable ICMP in Windows Firewall


LEARNING THE CODE:
==================

The code is heavily commented to help you learn. Here's what you'll learn:

✓ Windows socket programming (Winsock2)
✓ Windows API usage (IP Helper API)
✓ Network concepts (IP addresses, ping, latency)
✓ System command execution in C
✓ Error handling and input validation
✓ Cross-platform programming techniques

Start by reading the comments in network_utility.c, then read
CODE_EXPLANATION.md for detailed explanations.


NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Install compiler (see WINDOWS_SETUP.md)
2. Compile: gcc network_utility.c -o network_utility.exe -lws2_32 -liphlpapi
3. Run: network_utility.exe
4. Try all menu options
5. Read CODE_EXPLANATION.md to understand how it works
6. Modify the code and experiment!
